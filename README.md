# AI Reflection

## 2-3 prompts you asked AI

- What's the syntax to generate a random number?
- What's How do I convert a RGB value to a hexcode?
- Is it possible to include conditional styles using tailwind css?

## A sentence or two on how AI helped (debugging, design, etc.)

- AI was great to help debug, especially with styles. For example, I wanted a thicker border for my boxes, so I input `border-5` However, nothing was showing up, so I asked, `can you tell why my borders aren't showing up?` and it said that it was because tailwind CSS doesn't take `border-5` as a value.

## One thing you figured out on your own

I figured out conditional rendering of the components, logic behind defining game states, and storing data in my useStates.
